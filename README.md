# Introduction
"一个仿照牛客网实现的讨论社区，不仅实现了基本的注册，登录，发帖，评论，点赞，回复功能，同时使用前缀树实现敏感词过滤，使用wkhtmltopdf生成长图和pdf，实现网站UV和DAU统计，并将用户头像等信息存于云服务器"  

A community blog website prototype with common functionalities:   

- Implemented Trie Tree data structure to filter out sensitive words.  
- Used Spring Security for permission control to replace the interceptor, and applied personal authentication scheme to replace the security authentication process, making permission authentication and control more convenient and flexible.  
- Stored login tickets and verification codes with Redis to solve the problem of session distribution.  
- Applied Redis advanced data type HyperLogLog to count UV (Unique Visitor), and Bitmap to count DAU (Daily Active User).  
- Used Kafka to process system notifications such as comments, likes, and follows, and used event encapsulation to build a powerful asynchronous messaging system.
- Applied Elasticsearch for global search, and add keyword highlighting and other functions through event encapsulation.
- For the trending module, I used distributed cache Redis and local cache Caffeine as multi-level cache to avoid cache avalanche, increased QPS by 20 times (10-200), and greatly improved the website access speed. I also used Quartz to regularly update the hot thread ranking.
